Before becoming a software developer, I was a freelance scriptwriter writing short films and television pilots. Whilst I now write a different form of scripts, I still enjoy writing creatively but as a hobby. Now, my passion lies within technology and developing applications that benefit humanity. Whether it's for the web, on your mobile phone, or within augmented reality, I love to challenge myself and learn new, amazing things.

Although I now specialize in tech, I still love to write. Therefore, I started a blog called the [Mental Codeathon][1], where I write technical blogs. Whether it's how I deal under pressure in a team environment or learning TDDing in Java, I am always eager to give back to the community and share my experience.

Currently, I am working towards learning Python and Machine Learning, as well as develop an augmented reality experience for those who struggle with mental health (specifically anxiety and depression).
